# IoT for Humanity

**Open IoT solutions for humanitarian, civil, and social good.**

We are an open community building robust, low-power, and easy-to-use IoT systems that serve real-world needs. Especially in civil protection, humanitarian logistics, and socially relevant infrastructure.

Our mission is to make **simple, affordable, and resilient IoT technology** accessible to the people and organizations who need it most.

## Why IoT for Humanity?

IoT is powerful, can improve working conditions, and provide critical data when and where it's needed most. But many existing solutions are overly complex, cloud-dependent, or cost-prohibitive.

We focus on:
- **Offline-first** and **local-first** approaches
- **Low power** and **low maintenance** systems
- **Real-world tested** use cases (e.g. humanitarian kitchens)
- **Open Source** and community-driven development

## Current Projects

### [SimpleSense](https://github.com/iot-for-humanity/SimpleSense)
A minimal temperature monitoring system using MicroPython, a DS18B20 sensor, and a Raspberry Pi Pico W.
Designed to meet HACCP logging requirements for emergency kitchens.

- Wi-Fi auto-reconnect
- UDP-based transmission
- Energy-saving deep sleep cycles
- LED-coded state feedback
- Built-in watchdog and error handling

### StrongSense *(coming soon)*
Battery-powered ESP32 version for robust TLS communication, advanced power saving, and outdoor deployment.

### ServerSense *(coming soon)*
A lightweight local broker/server that logs incoming sensor data and optionally forwards it to cloud or GraphQL APIs. If you want to create one, add progamming-Language to name e.g. ServerSenseJava.
